Alea iacta est is a variation of a Latin phrase attributed by Suetonius to Julius Caesar on 10 January 49 BC, as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy, in defiance of the Roman Senate and beginning a long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase is often used to indicate events that have passed a point of no return.
The phrase was a quote from a play by Menander, and according to Plutarch, Caesar originally said the line in Greek rather than Latin.
